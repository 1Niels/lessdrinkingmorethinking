                  <p class="gbig"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The negative consequences of alcohol abuse affects not only individuals who consume alcohol but also their friends and families. Alcohol is not often thought of as a drug, yet it remains the most misused drug in the United States. One out of every three homicides are associated with alcohol misuse, one out of every two car accidents are linked to irresponsible consumption of alcohol. Alcohol has the ability to tear families apart and is a factor in the placement of more than three-quarters of the children entering foster care. In 1996, six million children under the age of 18 lived with a parent who was dependent upon alcohol. Irresponsible consumption of alcohol is corroding the basic structure of society by affecting human society in all aspects from destabilizing families to corrupting trustworth governments, it is the responsibility of all alcohol consumers to think before they drink.

            <p class="gbig"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Teens are not exempt from the negative effects from alcohol, if anything they are at the center of it. Nearly four out of every five students have consumed alcohol by the end of their high school career. Among high school seniors, more than half reported having been drunk at least once in their lifetime and one out of every three have been drunk in the past 30 days. A recently conducted study found that 31% of students met criteria for a diagnosis  of alcohol abuse and another 6% for alcohol dependence in the past year. Alcohol has numerous short and long term consequences on the teenage brain. Short-term consequences include intoxication, harder time making good decisions, decreased awareness of inappropriate behavior, increased chance of participating in risky behavior, and a greater chance of exhibiting violent or aggressive behavior. Long-term consequences include interference with normal brain development specifically the prefrontal cortex, decreased ability of information processing, decreased ability to learn, increased risk of developing an alcohol use disorder later in life.
