                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beer is among the worldâ€™s most popular most popular and oldest beverages humans have produced, it is surpassed only by water and tea. Beer dates back to at least the 5000 BC and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.

</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beer is produced in a process known as brewing which involves the fermentation of starches mainly derived from cereal grains and most commonly malted barley. Many countries define beer by law as in Germany where the standard ingredients besides water are malt, hops, and yeast.

</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before 6000 BC, beer was produced from barley in Sumer and Babylonia. Sculptures on Egyptian tombs dating from 2400 BC show that barley was crushed, mixed with water, and dried into cakes. When they were broken up and mixed with water the cakes gave an extract that was fermented by microorganisms which accumulated on the surfaces of fermenting vessels.

</p>
                 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beer and other alcoholic beverages can have positive health effects when drinking responsibly, however the numerous negative effects greatly outweigh the positive ones. Small consumption of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) has been associated with a decreased risk of stroke, cardiac disease, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate, or heavy alcohol consumption include but are not limited alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease, cancer, damage to the central nervous system, malnutrition, pancreatitis, esophageal cancer, peripheral nervous system damage, oropharyngeal cancer, hypertension, and a negative impact on aging.
