                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rum is a distilled liquor made from sugarcane products, such as molasses, and is usually produced as a byproduct of sugar manufacture and created through the process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, usually a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels. Rum originated in the West Indies and are first mentioned in records from Barbados in about 1650. Rum was first named as “kill-devil” then later named “rumbullion” and by 1667 it was simply called Rum. The majority of the world’s rum production still occurs in the Caribbean and Latin America. Rum is also produced in Spain, Australia, Austria, Fiji, the Philippines, Spain, India, Reunion Island, Mauritius, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, United States, Canada, and Japan.

                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rum has had a heavy influence on history, specifically the slave trade of American colonies. Slaves were brought from Africa and traded to the West Indies for molasses, the molasses was then made into rum in New England, and latter the rum was traded to Africa for more slaves. British sailors received regular rations of rum from the 18th century up until as recent of 1970. The popularity of rum continued after the American Revolution, with George Washington insisting on a barrel of Barbados rum be present during his 1789 inauguration. Rum also had major influence in the political system; candidates often attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. People would attend the hustings to find out which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was then expected to drink among the people to prove their independence and that they are truly republican. Restrictions on sugar imports from the British islands of the Caribbean were eventually imposed which led to a decline in the drink’s popularity in North America.
