            <p>Alcoholic beverages can have positive health effects when drinking responsibly, however the numerous negative effects greatly outweigh the positive ones. Small consumption of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) has been associated with a decreased risk of stroke, cardiac disease, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate, or heavy alcohol consumption include but are not limited alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease, cancer, damage to the central nervous system, malnutrition, pancreatitis, esophageal cancer, peripheral nervous system damage, oropharyngeal cancer, hypertension, and a negative impact on aging.

           <p>The consumption of alcohol causes intoxication which in many cases results in violence. Intoxicated people are much more likely to show signs of aggression, violence, and begin a fight. This behavior has the ability to ruin relationships between friends and family. Furthermore, intoxication causes loss of decision making skills which may lead to bad and insensitive decisions. While intoxicated, individuals are usually unaware of their actions and therefore do everything in order to ‘have fun’ without contemplating the consequences.

        <p>Alcohol has variety of mental effects including depression, anxiety, and mood swings. Alcohol acts as a depressant which causes an individual to feel more excited when happy but while sober it influences depression. The feeling of depression often convinces people to drink again and causes alcohol to be addictive. Alcohol decreases activity in the brain’s nervous system and along with physical stresses has the ability to cause anxiety. Serotonin levels decrease and the brain slows down from consuming alcohol. This effect has the ability to cause severe mood swings.
