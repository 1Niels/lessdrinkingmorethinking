                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Champagne is a classic sparkling produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region in northeastern France. Champagne production follows rules that demand secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, sourcing of grapes from certain parcels in the Champagne appellation, certain vineyard practices, and specific pressing regimes. The term Champagne is also often used as a generic term for sparkling wine, however in most countries it is illegal to label a product Champagne unless the product comes from the Champagne region of France and follows its rules. 
</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The popularity of Champagne can be attributed for its association with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims and as part of the coronation festivities Champagne was served. Leading manufactures used the association with kings to market Champagne with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging. Their effective marketing led to the popularity of Champagne among the emerging middle class of the time.
</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Champagne is often viewed as a healthier alcoholic beverage to drink because of its smaller serving size and low calorie count however Champagne has numerous downsides as well. Champagne often causes headaches and its acidity has been linked to cause teeth problems. Alcohol can have a few legitimate health benefits for adults as long as they drink responsibly. A scientific study observed the effect of various alcoholic beverages on human health and named five of the most harmful ones. Among this list was Champagne for its ability to speed up the process of decomposition in the intestines, which can cause poisoning. Some experts also claim that Champagne has the ability to get individuals drunk faster than other alcoholic beverages.
