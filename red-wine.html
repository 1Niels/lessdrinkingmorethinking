                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Red wine is a type of wine produced from dark-colored grape varieties. The color of red wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. After picking, the first step in creating wine is the physical processing of grapes. Then the grapes are destemmed and lightly crushed and the preservative sulfur dioxide is commonly added. Macerating enzymes are also commonly added to aid extraction of color and fruit flavours from the skins and to facilitate pressing. Winemakers then often chill the must to around 50°F to allow a period of pre-fermentation maceration. After the must is in a fermentation vessel, yeast which is naturally present on the skins of grapes begins the process of alcoholic fermentation. Once the wine is finished with fermentation the red wine is usually racked and aged before being bottled.

</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The earliest archaeological evidence of wine production has been found at sites as old as 6000 BC in Georgia, Iran, Greece, and Armenia. The “altered consciousness” (intoxication) produced by wine has been considered religious since its origin. The greeks worshiped Dionysus, the god of grape harvest, winemaking, fertility, and wine. Jesus’s Last Supper is responsible for making the consumption of ritual to be vital to the Christian Church

</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Red wine can be consumed without numerous negative health effects if it is consumed in moderation. However, even moderate consumption has the ability to disrupt sleeping patterns, and poses serious dangers if it is taken alongside medication such as acetaminophen, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. Alcohol may hinder weight loss or weight maintenance as well. Consumption can also increase the risk of liver inflammation and scarring, breast cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer.
